# slot_Machine
Slot Machine, Casino like build in Java with JavaFX programming added
For the Slot Machine I implemented a GUI window which has 3 images that may be randomly match after clicking the spin button.
You may as well enter any amount of money and deppending on the matching of the images you may receive an increase of your bet or if non-match you may not receive any money.
I implemented the random command to make the images appear randomly, as well as implementing ranges and lists.
